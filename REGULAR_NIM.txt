
HOW TO PLAY 'NIM' ( Traditional - 2 Player)

The rules of this game are very simple.

The game is played between 2 players. In the beginning, there will be an odd number of stacks (to ascertain there's a winner).
Each stack will contain an arbitrary number of elements. There will be a toss to determine which player will make the first move.
Then, taking turns, a player must remove at least one object and may remove any number of elements provided they all come from the same stack. 

The goal of the game is to take the last element or to clear the last stack. The player doing so is regarded as the WINNER.
