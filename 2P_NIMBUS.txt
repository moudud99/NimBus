
HOW TO PLAY 'NIM-BUS' ( Regular - 2 Player)

'NIMBUS' is a modified version of the traditional game of 'NIM'.
The rules of this game are very simple.
The game is played between 2 players. In the beginning, there will be an odd number of stacks (to ascertain there's a winner).
Each stack will contain an arbitrary number of elements. There will be a toss to determine which player will make the first move. Then, taking turns, each player will draw either 1 or 2 from any stack ( provided that the stack is non-empty and the move is valid ).
The player drawing the last element from a stack ( clearing a stack ) claims a point. 
The player with the most points is declared as the WINNER.
