‘NIMBUS’ is a modified version of the traditional game of ‘NIM’.
The rules of this game are very simple.
The game is played between n number of players ( n>2 ). In the beginning, there will be some stacks with a random number of elements. There will be a toss to determine in which order the players will make their moves. Then, taking turns, each player will draw either 1 or 2 from any stack ( provided that the stack is non-empty and the move is valid ). The player drawing the last element from a stack ( clearing a stack ) claims a point. 
The player with the most points is declared as the WINNER.
